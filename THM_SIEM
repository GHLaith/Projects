I just completed the Introduction to SIEM room on THM.
This module covered the fundamentals of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), 
how it works behind the scenes, and the core features security teams use to detect, investigate, and respond to threats. Good introduction to log analysis, alerting, and monitoring workflows.
