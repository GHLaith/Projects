Just completed the Systems as Attack Vectors room on THM.

This module covered how attackers exploit vulnerable, misconfigured, or exposed systems to gain footholds in an environment.

I explored common system level attack vectors such as unpatched services, weak configurations, insecure protocols, and privilege escalation paths.

The room also highlighted how defenders mitigate these threats through hardening, patch management, log monitoring, vulnerability assessments, and secure configuration baselines.
