In this lab exercise, I learned how to block malicious traffic while allowing legitimate traffic:

- Malicious packets were marked red, legitimate ones green
- The target protocol to block was port 80
- Configured the firewall to prevent malicious packets from reaching the web server at 203.0.110.1

It was a great way to see stateful vs. stateless traffic filtering in action and understand how firewalls protect networks in real scenarios.
