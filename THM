This is me finishing Intro to LAN it focused on foundational networking concepts,
what I really loved was being able to actually participate in labs and apply what I already knew in a hands on way.
Playing with IP & MAC addresses, switches, routers, TCP/UDP, and DHCP made the learning real and memorable. I'm very excited to keep building and refining practical skills that matter in cybersecurity.
