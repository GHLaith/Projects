🛡️ Just completed the “SOC L1 Alert Triage” room on TryHackMe!

This module focused on developing a structured approach to triaging SOC alerts, reviewing event data, validating true vs. false positives, and prioritizing incidents based on impact and severity. 

I explored how L1 analysts use log analysis, correlation, threat intel, and escalation workflows to handle alerts efficiently and maintain situational awareness across an environment.
