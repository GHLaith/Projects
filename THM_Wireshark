Just completed the Wireshark: The Basics 
This module gave me a strong foundation in Wireshark and hands-on experience analyzing real network traffic. The labs were especially valuable, covering the following:

- Packet Capturing & Interface Monitoring 
Learned how to capture live traffic, navigate the Wireshark interface, and break down packet structure using the packet list, details, and bytes views.

 - Protocol Analysis
Worked with common protocols like HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, ARP, and ICMP, examining how devices communicate and how protocol fields reveal what’s happening on the network.

- PCAP Investigations
Analyzed several PCAP files to trace communication paths, follow TCP streams, identify request/response pairs, and spot unusual traffic patterns.

- Filtering & Searching
Used display filters to isolate specific traffic (e.g., http, tcp.flags.syn == 1, dns.qry.name) and learned how to quickly extract useful insights from busy captures.

- Traffic Behavior Recognition
Practiced spotting normal vs. abnormal traffic, connection attempts, handshake behavior, latency indicators, and potential signs of malicious activity.

Overall, this room was an excellent deep dive into the fundamentals of network analysis and one of the more fun labs I've participated in.
