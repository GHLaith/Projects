I just completed the Pre Security learning path on TryHackMe!
Cybersecurity is often seen as something only the elite can do, but this learning path proves that anyone can start building real skills, regardless of experience level.

- Learned the fundamentals of networking, system architecture, and basic security concepts.
- Explored common threats and vulnerabilities in hands-on exercises.
- Practiced using tools like nmap and Wireshark to analyze network traffic.
- Completed interactive challenges to understand password security, authentication, and encryption basics.

 This path gave me an amazing foundation for cybersecurity principles and practical skills, making the jump into more advanced topics much more intriguing and thought provoking.
