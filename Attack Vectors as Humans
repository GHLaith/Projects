Just finished the “Humans as Attack Vectors” room on THM.

This module explored how attackers exploit human behavior through techniques like phishing, social engineering, credential harvesting, and psychological manipulation. I also learned how SOC teams identify, monitor, and respond to these human focused attacks through alerting, threat intel, user behavior analysis, and awareness training.

Strengthening the human layer is a critical part of modern cybersecurity, and this room helped reinforce how defenders play a keyrole in reducing people based attack risks.
