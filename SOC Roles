Just completed the “SOC Roles in the Blue Team” room on TryHackMe!

This module gave me a deeper look into how Security Operations Centers function and the responsibilities across SOC tiers. I explored the workflow of L1, L2, and L3 analysts, how incidents are escalated, and how different roles contribute to threat detection, investigation, and response.

Understanding these roles is essential for building a strong foundation in defensive security and advancing within a SOC environment. Another step forward in strengthening my blue team skills!
