I have completed the Splunk: The Basics room on TryHackMe.
This module introduced how SOC analysts use Splunk for real log investigations and threat detection. 

The hands-on labs walked me through:
🔹 Navigating the Splunk Interface

 Learned how to explore dashboards, search logs, and interpret event data efficiently.

🔹 SPL Search Fundamentals
 Practiced core Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) commands to filter, parse, and analyze logs (stats, table, fields, rex, etc.).

🔹 Log Investigation Workflows
 Worked through simulated SOC tasks, pivoting between logs, correlating events, and identifying suspicious activity across different data sources.

🔹 Security Use Cases
 Analyzed authentication logs, firewall events, and endpoint alerts to spot anomalies, bruteforce attempts, and indicators of compromise.

🔹 Alerts & Dashboards Basics
 Explored how dashboards visualize log patterns and how alerts are triggered to notify analysts of potential threats.
