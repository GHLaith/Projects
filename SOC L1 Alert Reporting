📣 Just completed the “SOC L1 Alert Reporting” room on TryHackMe!
This module covered how to properly document, communicate, and escalate high risk SOC alerts. 

I learned how L1 analysts structure incident reports, summarize key indicators, highlight impact, and provide clear evidence for L2/L3 teams. 
The room also emphasized the importance of accurate logging, concise communication, escalation criteria, and reporting workflows within a SOC environment.

Building strong reporting skills is essential for effective incident response and collaboration across security teams.
